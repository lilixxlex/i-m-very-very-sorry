        <h1>A letter to this old friend</h1>
        <h3>I'm very sorry</h3>
        <p>I'm so sorry for who I am, and what I put you through. I would SO LOVE to catch up but you gave me enough luck; I admit it.<br>

            IF I could make a wish it wouldn't be to change my family or stuff like that (you know why I say that),<br>
            but yes, so that as soon as I don't make any mistakes; but of course there always have to be fights in a relationship; it is obligatory.<br>
            
            But we got away more because of me than anything else, I attract problems, I really have bad luck.<br>
            But that's life, and there's nothing you can do about it.<br>
            <br>
            I will improve myself, thinking of you, then I will say to myself that it is thanks to you that I have improved..finally if I change; but I assure you that I will change.<br>
            It will surely take months, years of course, but it will have helped me finally you will have helped me.<br>
            I understand that you don't forgive me, but when you need me, no matter [i'll feeling, problems, want to talk, sad or even want to die...]<br>
            know that I am there even if we are no longer friends.<br>
            <br>
            Do you know how many times I told you that ? I don't know anymore, but I know that I've told you so many times.<br>
            And..you have already seen me tell someone a secret, if such a person told me that or such a person..in any case,<br>
            I have never heard myself say that (I am not saying that I I'm holy, I'm an angel and I have a big oreola on my head, no!)<br>
            I'm just telling you that whatever you tell me, I won't tell ANYBODY.<br>
            <br>
            I will always love you !<br>
